## Description

Love Fern is an application that allows the user to cultivate their relationships with others in their lives, by taking care of a fern. This is the backend service of the application.

## Getting Started

This is a Ruby on Rails application which establishes API endpoints to be called in the `love_fern_fe` repository. To run the application locally, both frontend and backend repositories will need to be cloned and set up.

### Installation

To install gems, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then to establish a database, run:

```bash
rails db:create
```

Because this is the back end repository, database migration is also necessary, run:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Inspect the `/db/schema.rb` and compare to the 'Schema' section below to ensure this migration has been done successfully.

### RSpec Suite

Once `love_fern_be` is correctly installed, run tests locally to ensure the repository works as intended.

To test the entire spec suite, run:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/
```

All tests should be passing if installation is successful.

### Calling APIs

- APIs can be called locally using a program like [Postman](https://www.postman.com). 

## Available Endpoints

*Note:* Necessary parameters marked with {}

### Create a New User
*Note:* pass `name`, `google_id`, & `email` in request body

```bash
POST '/api/v1/users'
```

### Return all ferns for user

```bash
GET '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns'
```

### Create a New Fern

*Note:* pass `name`, `shelf`, & `preferred_contact_method` in request body

```bash
POST '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns'
```

### Return Single Fern (Fern Show)

```bash
GET '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns/{fern_id}'
```

### Update Fern Status (Water Fern) 

*Note:* pass `interaction` as the message to be analyzed in response body 

```bash
PATCH '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns/{fern_id}'
```

### Update Fern Information [Name / Shelf / Contact Method]

*Note:* pass `name`, `shelf`, or `preferred_contact_method` in request body

```bash
PATCH '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns/{fern_id}'
```

### Delete Fern

```bash
DELETE '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/ferns/{fern_id}'
```

### Get All Shelves & Ferns

```bash
GET '/api/v1/users/{google_id}/shelves'
```

### Get One Random Activity Suggestion

```bash
GET '/api/v1/activities'
```

## Goals

Love Fern was germinated to satisfy the requirements (and beyond) for a Turing Backend Mod 3 group project, **Consultancy**. See official [project requirements](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/consultancy/).

### Learning Goals

- Design easily consumable API end-points to create accessible, robust backend service.
- Implement a secure connection between front and backend services deployed to Heroku. 
- Interact with two unique external APIs with efficient data processing and caching.

### Future Goals

- Implement "Soil Moisture" which indicates how often a user wishes to interact with their fern before the soil is completely dry.
- Add the ability to search for a fern by name and order ferns by health.
- Suggest multiple activities and gestures corresponding to varying levels of care needed for the fern.
- Implement a homegrown sentiment analysis feature to pair with Google's services, eventually reducing dependence on external services.

### Known Issues

- In current state, sentiment analysis has linear affect on fern status.
- No automated system for generating secret keys to authenticate new FE services.
